Galaxy tool to sub-sample sequence files
========================================

This tool is copyright 2014-2023 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below (MIT licence).

This tool is a short Python script (using Biopython library functions)
to sub-sample sequence files (in a range of formats including FASTA, FASTQ,
and SFF). This can be useful for preparing a small sample of data to test
or time a new pipeline, or for reducing the read coverage in a de novo
assembly.

This tool is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

* http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/sample_seqs


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward using the Galaxy Tool Shed, which should be
able to automatically install the dependency on Biopython, and then install
this tool and run its unit tests.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install to use this tool from within Galaxy:

* ``sample_seqs.py`` (the Python script)
* ``sample_seqs.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in a dedicated ``tools/sample_seqs`` folder.

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. One suggested location is in the filters section. Simply add the line::

    <tool file="sample_seqs/sample_seqs.xml" />

You will also need to install Biopython 1.62 or later.

If you wish to run the unit tests, also move/copy the ``test-data/`` files
under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` folder. Then::

    ./run_tests.sh -id sample_seqs

That's it.


History

======= ======================================================================
Version Changes
------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.1  - Initial version.
v0.1.1  - Using ``optparse`` to provide a proper Python command line API.
v0.1.2  - Interleaved mode for working with paired records.
        - Tool definition now embeds citation information.
v0.2.0  - Option to give number of sequences (or pairs) desired.
          This works by first counting all your sequences, then calculates
          the percentage required in order to sample them uniformly (evenly).
          This makes two passes through the input and is therefore slower.
v0.2.1  - Was missing a file for the functional tests.
        - Included testing of stdout messages.
        - Includes testing of failure modes.
v0.2.2  - Reorder XML elements (internal change only).
        - Use ``format_source=...`` tag.
        - Planemo for Tool Shed upload (``.shed.yml``, internal change only).
v0.2.3  - Do the Biopython imports at the script start (internal change only).
        - Clarify paired read example in help text.
v0.2.4  - Depends on Biopython 1.67 via legacy Tool Shed package or bioconda.
        - Style changes to Python code (internal change only).
v0.2.5  - Use ``<command detect_errors="aggressive">`` (internal change only).
        - Single quote command line arguments (internal change only).
v0.2.6  - Bumped Biopython dependency version for Python 3 fixes.

For pushing a release to the test or main "Galaxy Tool Shed", use the following
Planemo commands (which requires you have set your Tool Shed access details in
``~/.planemo.yml`` and that you have access rights on the Tool Shed)::

    $ planemo shed_update -t testtoolshed --check_diff tools/sample_seqs/
    ...

or::

    $ planemo shed_update -t toolshed --check_diff tools/sample_seqs/
    ...

To just build and check the tar ball, use::

    $ planemo shed_upload --tar_only tools/sample_seqs/
    ...
    $ tar -tzf shed_upload.tar.gz
